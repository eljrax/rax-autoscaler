Monitoring Plugins
==================

These plugins are used to provide different ways to determing whether to scale up or down.  Currently there are 2 monitoring plugins available.

Raxmon
------
Plugin for Rackspace monitoring.

Uses Rackspace cloud monitoring to check a server statstic and use it to make a scaling
decision.  The statistic is averaged over all currently active servers in the scaling group.
The plugin will create the check on the servers if it does not currently exist.  The Rackspace
monitoring agent must be installed on all servers in the scaling group and should be part of
your launch_configuration.


This is used to help smooth out fluctuations in the connection count so we do not scale on small
fluctuations.

Config should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

     "raxmon":{
         "scale_up_threshold": 0.6,
         "scale_down_threshold": 0.4,
         "check_config": {},
         "metric_name": "1m",
         "check_type": "agent.load_average",
         "max_samples": 10
     }

scale_up_threshold - Set this to a value that makes sense for the check you are performing.
If we go over this number we will scale up.

scale_down_threshold - Set this to a value that makes sense for the check you are performing.
If we go under this number we will scale down.

check_config (optional) - configuration options for the check we will be performing.  Used when
we are creating the check on servers that don't have it.

check_type - What type of check to perform.  Default is agent.load_average (check servers load
average)

metric_name - Name of metric checked.  We are checking the load_average over 1 minute periods
so the metric name could be 1m.  Default is 1m

max_samples - How many samples to pull from Rackspace monitoring, this helps limit the number
of API calls so you don't go over the daily limit.

Raxclb
------
Plugin for Rackspace cloud load balancer.


This checks the load balancer connection counts and uses it to make a scaling decision.
The algorithm is:

    (current_connection * 1.5 + historical_connection) / 2

This is used to help smooth out fluctuations in the connection count so we do not scale on small
fluctuations.

Config should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

    "raxclb":{
        "scale_up_threshold": 100,
        "scale_down_threshold": 10,
        "check_type": "SSL"
        "loadbalancers":[]
    }


scale_up_threshold - How many connections per server you want to handle.  We will multiply
this number by the number of servers currently active in the group.  If we go over this
number we will scale up.  Default is 50

scale_down_threshold - How many connections per server you want to handle.  We will multiply
this number by the number of servers currently active in the group.  If we go under this
number we will scale down.  Default is 1

check_type - set this to SSL if you want to check SSL connection counts instead of
regular http.  Default is to **not** check SSL.

loadbalancers - provide a list of loadbalancer ids to check.  If you do not provide
this we will detect the loadbalancer(s) in use by the scaling group and check all of them
and aggregate results.  Otherwise we will only check the loadbalancer ids you provide here.
Default is an empty list (Auto-detect loadbalancers).

New Relic
---------
Plugin for New Relic monitoring

Connects to New Relic monitoring API to view data and make a scaling decision based on that data.

Config should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

     "newrelic":{
         "api_key": "",
         "application_name":"<optional>",
         "scale_up_threshold": 0.6,
         "scale_down_threshold": 0.4,
         "metric_name": "System/Load",
         "metric_value": "average_value"
     }

api_key - this should be set to the your New Relic api key

scale_up_threshold - Set this to a value that makes sense for the check you are performing.
If we go over this number we will scale up.

scale_down_threshold - Set this to a value that makes sense for the check you are performing.
If we go under this number we will scale down.

metric_name - a valid New Relic metric name

metric_value - a valid New Relic metric value.

To see valid metric names and values please use the New Relic API explorer.

Creating Plugins
================

All monitoring plugins should inherit from raxas.core_plugins.base.  You must implement a make_decision
function that returns a 1 for scale up, -1, for scale down, or 0 for do nothing.::

    from raxas.core_plugins.base import PluginBase
    class Yourplugin(PluginBase):
        def __init__(self, scaling_group, config, args):
        super(Yourplugin, self).__init__(scaling_group, config, args)
